					<strong>do you listen to music?</strong>
					<br>
					Q: YES. i started in middle school when i listened to the radio while doing my homework. over time i found various online communities that gave me music recommendations.
					then i started the classic pipeline: youtube playlists --> wait spotify is better --> i want to make good playlists to share --> youtube reviewers (watch toddintheshadows!) --> 
					i want to make my own reviews --> rateyourmusic.com layout sucks. 
					<br>
					<br>
					i also played the piano for two years. playing an instrument doesn't make you like music though. the true way is to be forced to listen to the same five hot 100 
					pop songs everytime you turn on the radio.
